# About Me
My name is Elaina McHargue, and I am currently an Applied Computing and Informatics and Neuroscience student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO), and I plan to pursue a master's degree in Biomedical Informatics through UNO upon completing my undergrad. I am interested in using computer science and data analytics to solve real-world biological problems.
